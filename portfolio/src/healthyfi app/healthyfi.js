            <div className='line'>
                <p>Healthy-Fi is an app which is designed for the use of the doctors to recommend the physiotherapy exercises time to time and keep a record of it in a very easy online way. It also provides some other premium facilities to the customer.</p>
                <div className='subheading'> Assumptions</div>
                <p>1. The account is created by the doctors to keep the record of the patient.<br/> 2. User has a good internet connectivity.</p>

            <div className="headings"> <Heading heading='Problem Statement'/> </div>
            <div className='line'>
                <p>After too many visits to trainer for physiotherapy an idea of shifting this in an online mode passed my mind. The motive of designing this was to decrease the number of visits to the doctor and be able to manage the deadlines easily.</p>

            <div className="headings"> <Heading heading='UX Research'/> </div>
            <div className='line'>
                <p> After having done some research from googling, taking notes from some exercising apps and talking to related people I finalized the problems that will be solved.
                    For building the trust with the user and relating it to the hospital/doctor I decided to go with the color scheme of Blue. Also I concluded that the target audience for my app would be the people between the age of 22- 50 and hence I decided to go with the minimal and familiar UI design so as to make people of older age comfortable in using the app.</p>

                <p> This was the raw idea according to which I decided to move forward with, after my research. I kept on taking inputs from people around me by talking to them personally or through google forms and tried to solve their concerns. </p>

                <p> This was my first app design and I learnt a lot from this project. I was scared to work with the dark mode and I challenged myself for the same.</p>
                <p>I learnt about the importance of user persona and keeping things simple yet beautiful. I hope to keep learning and designing much better products than this :).</p>
